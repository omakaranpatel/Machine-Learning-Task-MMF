# Machine-Learning-Task-MMF
Machine Learning Task

💡 Machine Learning Task – MMF
This project showcases a typical machine learning workflow applied to the Adult Income Dataset, with the goal of predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on demographic and employment-related features.

📁 Project Structure
Data Source:

au_train.csv – Training data

au_test.csv – Testing data

Notebook:

Machine_learning_Task_MMF.ipynb – Full ML pipeline including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

🔍 What’s Inside
The notebook walks through:

Data Exploration:

Viewing samples of the dataset

Identifying and handling missing or inconsistent values (' ?' replaced with NaN)

Data Cleaning:

Missing values imputed using the most frequent value (mode)

Features like occupation, workclass, and native-country were cleaned

Feature Engineering (implied to follow):

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling or transforming numerical features

Modeling (expected further in notebook):

Model selection and training

Evaluation using accuracy and other metrics

⚙️ Requirements
To run the notebook, you’ll need:
         pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the notebook.

Place au_train.csv and au_test.csv in the appropriate directory (/content/ if using Google Colab).

Run the notebook step-by-step to explore the pipeline.

📊 Output
At the end of the notebook, you can expect to see:

A trained classification model

Evaluation results such as accuracy or confusion matrix

Visual insights from data and model performance

🧠 Learning Outcome
This notebook serves as a great hands-on example for:

Cleaning real-world messy data

Building classification models

Working with demographic datasets
